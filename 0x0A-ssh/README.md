## 0x0A. SSH

**What you should learn from this project**

       At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to
       anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a server
* Where server usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair

**Requirements**

* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash

The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash for instance is that it will make your script portable for different OS where Bash might be in a different location.
