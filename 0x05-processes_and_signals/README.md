## 0x05. Processes and signals

**What you should learn from this project**

       At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain,
       without the help of Google:

* What is a PID
* What is a process
* How to find a process PID
* How to kill a process
* What is a signal
* What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

## Exercises

**0. What is my PID**

**2. Show your Bash PID**

     Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays line
     containing the bash word, this allowing you to easily get the PID of your
     Bash process

Requirements:

* You cannot use pgrep

**5. Kill me now**

     We killed our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous
     task, there is actually another way to do this.

     Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

**6. Kill me now made easy**

     Write a Bash script that kills 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
